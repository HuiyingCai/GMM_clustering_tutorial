This tutorial demonstrates how to apply GMM clustering to identify different L2 writing performance profiles in an assessment context based on an array of linguistic complexity (LC) features. It also examines the relationships between the identified profiles and proficiency levels, with the assumption that higher-proficiency test-takers tend to produce more linguistically complex language.

The data analyzed in the tutorial is not available. Please try to follow the steps using your own dataset.
